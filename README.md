# OESM
Open Earth System Model for Climate Research

OESM is a climate model for long-term (multi-millennial) simulations. It is used for paleoclimate research and future projections. 
It consists of the [OSU version of the UVic climate model](https://github.com/OSU-CEOAS-Schmittner/UVic2.9) coupled to the Penn State ice sheet model (currently only representing the Antarctic Ice Sheet).
