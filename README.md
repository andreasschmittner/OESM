# OESM
Open Earth System Model for Climate Research

OESM is a climate model for long-term (multi-millennial) simulations. It is used for paleoclimate research and future projections. 
It consists of the OSU version of the UVic climate model [(OSUVic](https://github.com/OSU-CEOAS-Schmittner/UVic2.9) coupled to the Penn State ice sheet model (currently only representing the Antarctic Ice Sheet).

Documentation and how-to-guide is provided at the [wiki](https://github.com/andreasschmittner/OESM/wiki).
